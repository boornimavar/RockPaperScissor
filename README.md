# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Overview
This is a beginner-level Rock Paper Scissors project developed as part of The Odin Project. The game follows the traditional rules of Rock Paper Scissors but with a unique twist: each option (Rock, Paper, Scissors) is represented by a character.

## Characters
- **Rock**: Dwayne Johnson
- **Paper**: William Shakespeare
- **Scissors**: Sza

## To-Do
- [ ] Count the number of times each character is picked by both the user and the opponent.
- [ ] Only count the winning side's picks.
- [ ] Display scores for each character.
- [ ] Show GIFs and play music related to the character with the most counts when the game is over.


## Usage
1. Click on the Rock, Paper, or Scissors buttons to make your choice.
2. The computer will randomly select its choice.
3. The winner is determined based on the traditional Rock Paper Scissors rules.
4. The scores are updated, and the game announces the winner after a set number of rounds.

(hopefully i will all these when i complete the intermediate level of js)
